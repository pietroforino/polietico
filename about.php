      <h2 style="text-align:left">
        While you are waiting for the subway, while you are ''studying'' for the exam, while you are waiting for your girlfriend or while you are doing that big one, Scribble Loop will be there to take you by the hand and bring you to a total waste of time.

        Scribble Loop is a web platform that allows anyone to create infinite drawings in collaboration with many other people. Each user can start with a preset scribble or can join a scribble that has already been started by other users.  The aim is to try to include the previous scribbles with your drawing, creating a collaborative and potentially endless work of art. When you are done, send your scribble to the Loop! Future users will go on with the journey from there.
